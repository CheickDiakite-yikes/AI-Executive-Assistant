## 🌟 Vision
In a world of information overload, Maya acts as your digital chief of staff. She doesn't just answer questions; she anticipates needs, prepares dossiers for your meetings, monitors market pulses, and drafts strategic memos from your spoken thoughts.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎙️ Voice-First Interaction (Gemini Live)
Engage in low-latency, natural conversations. Maya listens, thinks, and speaks with human-like prosody, allowing for hands-free productivity while you drive, walk, or work.

### 👁️ Visual Intelligence
With integrated camera support, Maya can see what you see. Show her a printed chart, a prototype, or a whiteboard session, and she will provide instant analysis and documentation.

### 🖼️ Intelligent Canvas
Instead of a static chat history, Maya uses a dynamic **Canvas** to display:
- **Live Deal Dossiers**: Instant intelligence on companies and people before meetings.
- **Market Pulse**: Real-time financial tickers and performance sparklines.
- **Strategy Memos**: Automated debriefs from your meetings into Risks, Decisions, and Action Items.
- **Email & Calendar**: Seamlessly manage your schedule and correspondence with proactive drafting.

### 🎭 Multi-Persona Architecture
Choose the partner that matches your current goal:
- **Maya**: The creative collaborator.
- **Atlas**: The precise, strategic operator.
- **Nova**: The high-energy execution specialist.
- **Zorra**: The empathetic "bestie" and executive partner.
